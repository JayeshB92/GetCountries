GetCountries
============

This is my fork of the peric/GetCountries repository. The additional feature is YAML data generation. 

<i>YAML data generation added; According to YAML guidelines, each space is not a TAB character, but a group of two spaces. Thus, space formatting is implemented here.</i>

All data is fetched from geonames.org
